    <P><H2>i carry your heart with me</H2>
        i carry your heart with me (i carry it in
        my heart) i am never without it (anywhere
        i go you go, my dear; and whatever is done
        by only me is your doing, my darling)
                                          i fear
        no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet) i want
        no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true)
        and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant
        and whatever a sun will always sing is you
        
        here is the deepest secret nobody knows
        (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
        and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows
        higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)
        and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart
        
        i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)
    </P>
