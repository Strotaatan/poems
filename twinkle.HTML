        <H2>TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR</H2><br>
     
  

    <P>  Twinkle, twinkle, little star, <br>
        How I wonder what you are! <br>
        Up above the world so high, <br>
        Like a diamond in the sky. <br> <br>
        
        When the blazing sun is gone, <br>
        When he nothing shines upon, <br>
        Then you show your little light, <br>
        Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. <br><br>
        
        Then the trav’ller in the dark, <br>
        Thanks you for your tiny spark, <br>
        He could not see which way to go, <br>
        If you did not twinkle so. <br><br>
        
        In the dark blue sky you keep, <br>
        And often thro’ my curtains peep, <br>
        For you never shut your eye, <br>
        Till the sun is in the sky. <br><br>
        
        ‘Tis your bright and tiny spark, <br>
        Lights the trav’ller in the dark, <br>
        Tho’ I know not what you are, <br>
        Twinkle, twinkle, little star. <br> </b></P>
